::: notes
-   You may know us as R4DS or the R4DS Online Learning Community
-   Started as a book club for that one book, but
    -   We've never been affiliated with that book
    -   We cover much more than that one book
-   Now we're the data science learning community
-   If you want to learn anything about data science, we're here to help.

-   I was lucky when I started to learn Data Science.
    -   Found a friendly community on social media.
    -   I have advantages that not everybody has.
-   Let's make sure everybody has a good learning experience.
-   Tools and resources are focused in these areas:

::: notes
-   Start: R4DS
-   Added Advanced R in April 2020 (bored at home)
-   Book clubs across all data science topics, not just R
-   Relevant here: Lots of shiny books.
-   TMWR while they wrote it
-   I'm writing a book about Web APIs with R, we have a club where I'm figuring out the book as we go.
-   Books and book-like things like online courses and even pkgdown sites.
    -   Just needs to be free (legally) online.
-   Require at least 5 members to start, 5-6 is ideal.
    -   (Don't move forward yet)
    -   1-hour weekly meeting
    -   1 person leads discussion of a chapter
    -   Shared slide decks that we're developing collaboratively
    -   I've worked in educational publishing for about 25 years, sneak in best practices
-   (Next slide) Vids on YouTube, so it's ok to miss a week
-   Also post meeting chat to Slack.
-   The name "R4DS Online Learning Community" became less and less accurate.

:::

::: notes
-   Slack is central, so I developed shinyslack to link Slack users to Shiny activity.
    -   And abstracted cookies and scenes out of that, both of those are on CRAN.
-   Bookclubber app for finding a time slot that works for everyone.
-   Originally developed by Priyanka Gagneja (community member).
-   User's timezone auto-detected
-   Shaded cells are popular times
-   I know this isn't pretty, but it works!
    -   Join the community if you'd like to help improve it!

🎦 [Learning by Teaching](https://posit.co/resources/videos/learning-by-teaching-mentoring-at-the-r4ds-online-learning-community/) me @ rstudio::conf(2020)
:::

::: notes
-   #help- channels to ask and answer questions
    -   From the start: code of conduct has encouraged friendliness.
    -   "The anti stack overflow." Don't make people feel bad for asking questions.
-   Everyone has things they don't know yet.
-   Most "enforcement" has been more like teaching tips, like avoiding the word "just" when answering questions.
-   Lightning talk: "Learning by Teaching", because answering questions is a great way to practice and cement skills
    -   Step up from book clubs.
    -   Strongly encouraged at all skill levels.

:::

::: notes
-   Mentordash = unanswered question tracker
-   This one is older, and has had more help from the community.
    -   Tan Ho did most of the UI.
-   We try to keep that at 0, but here it was relatively high!
-   Loads live data from Slack

# How can I help?

## Contribute

::: fragment
👩‍🏫 Answer questions on Slack: [dslc.io/mentordash](https://dslc.io/mentordash)
:::
::: fragment
✅ Facilitate a book club cohort 
:::
::: fragment
✨ Contribute to Shiny apps 
:::

::: notes
-   Come to DSLC.io to join our Slack!
    -   Answering questions is a great way to learn!
    -   Try to keep replies in threads so mentordash can keep track
-   Must participate in a club first, but 
    -   after you do we can always use facilitators
    -   Times are chosen out of your choices, so it's guaranteed to work for you
-   Convince me to let you contribute!
    -   I'm trying to make the github repos welcoming
    -   Bookclubber exists because Priyanka Gagneja made a v1.
    -   Automatic processing happens because Kevin Kent sorted out how to interact with the YouTube API. 
    -   I mentioned needing help, they ran with them.

## Sponsorship

💸 Grants and sponsorships helpful!
:::
::: fragment
🙏 Grateful for all contributions
:::

::: notes
-   We're a collective in the Open Collective Foundation, which makes us count as a 501c3 charitable organization for US taxes.
    -   OCF dissolved suddenly last month
    -   Need a STABLE new host by end of September
-   Even before then we can start working out details of grants and sponsorships!
    -   I don't get paid for any of this yet.
    -   My dream is to work on this full time.
-   We had a fundraiser last month while we still could, and my heart is warmed by the response.
    -   Will let us keep things running, but won't get us all the way to where I envision us going.
