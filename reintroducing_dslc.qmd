-   Hadley retweeted Jesse,
-   as did another 733 people.
-   Jesse started a book club and invited #RStats to join.
-   About *200 people* in that initial cohort, grew, slacked off, then grew again with a second cohort.

:::

::: notes
-   Jesse had great code of conduct and Slack posts emphasizing that everyone was there to learn.
-   When I took over the following year, I had a policy to reply to every new member's introduction post with a friendly message setting the tone.
-   Teaching tips like "don't say 'just'".
-   Jesse's talk caused a bump in membership.
-   I'm not sure what the bump was on June 6. Probably another retweet.
-   useR! is the smaller bump at the end. Virtual.

:::
::: fragment
💻  Slack channel per book for asynchronous discussion
:::

::: notes
-   Books and book-like things like online courses and even pkgdown sites.
-   Require at least 5 members to start, 5-6 is ideal.
-   (Don't move forward yet)
-   1-hour weekly meeting
    -   1 person leads discussion of a chapter
    -   Shared slide decks that we're developing collaboratively
    -   (Next slide) Vids on YouTube, so it's ok to miss a week
-   Also post meeting chat to Slack.

❓ More? 
:::

::: notes
-   Login using DSLC Slack account
-   Bookclubber = app for finding a time for new clubs
-   (next) Ugly, but functional. 
    -   User's timezone auto-detected
    -   Shaded cells are popular times
-   Mentordash = unanswered question tracker
    -   We try to keep that at 0, but here it was relatively high!
    -   Loads live data from Slack
-   More: Now that we have the shinyslack infrastructure, it's relatively easy to attach more apps to our Slack data.

## Benefits of Using Shiny

::: fragment
➰ Flexible 
:::
::: fragment
🏃‍♀️ Quick turnaround
:::
::: fragment
👩‍🎓 Community can contribute!
:::

::: notes
-   I probably don't have to convince people here of these benefits, but..
-   Flexible: Not just a drag-and-drop with set options
-   Quick: Can have a prototype in a day
-   Community: Collaborating on the app would be a great way to learn!

# How You Can Help

## Volunteer Opportunities

::: fragment
👩‍🏫 Answer questions on Slack
:::
::: fragment
✅ Facilitate a book club cohort 
:::
::: fragment
✨ Contribute to Shiny apps 
:::


::: notes
-   Come to DSLC.io to join our Slack!
    -   Answering questions is a great way to learn!
    -   Try to keep replies in threads so mentordash can keep track
-   Must participate in a club first, but 
    -   after you do we can always use facilitators
    -   Times are chosen out of your choices, so it's guaranteed to work for you
-   Convince me to let you contribute!
    -   I'm trying to make the github repos welcoming
    -   Bookclubber exists because Priyanka Gagneja made a v1.
    -   Automatic processing happens because Kevin Kent sorted out how to interact with the YouTube API.

## Donations and Sponsorships

🔍 Seeking a new fiscal host
:::
::: fragment
💸 Grants and sponsorships helpful!
:::
::: fragment
🙏 Grateful for all contributions
:::

::: notes
-   We're a collective in the Open Collective Foundation, which makes us count as a 501c3 charitable organization.
-   OCF dissolved suddenly last month
-   Need a STABLE new host by end of September
-   Even before then we can start working out details of grants and sponsorships!
-   We had a fundraiser last month while we still could, and my heart is warmed by the response.
:::

## Spread the Word

::: fragment
📢 Promote [DSLC.io](https://dslc.io) on social media
:::
::: fragment
👩‍💼 Participate in clubs with colleagues
:::

::: notes
-   Our contact info is on the next slide
-   Even if we aren't active on a given platform, send people our way!
-   A great way to bring people into the fold is to participate in a club as a group
    -   Learning how to do your job counts as work!
    -   If several of you join, you can probably set the time/day!
