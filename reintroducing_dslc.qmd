-   Hadley retweeted Jesse,
-   as did another 733 people.
-   Jesse started a book club and invited #RStats to join.
-   About *200 people* in that initial cohort, grew, slacked off, then grew again with a second cohort.

::: notes
-   Jesse had great code of conduct and Slack posts emphasizing that everyone was there to learn.
-   When I took over the following year, I had a policy to reply to every new member's introduction post with a friendly message setting the tone.
-   Teaching tips like "don't say 'just'".
-   Jesse's talk caused a bump in membership.
-   I'm not sure what the bump was on June 6. Probably another retweet.
-   useR! is the smaller bump at the end. Virtual.
